- **History Rewriting with `git filter-repo`:** Remove sensitive data or modify commit history.  
- **Advanced Stashing with `git stash`:** Save and apply partial or specific changes.  
- **Deep Analysis with `git blame`:** Investigate the history of specific lines of code.  
- **Cleanup with `git clean`:** Remove untracked files and directories.
